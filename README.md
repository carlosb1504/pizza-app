# Love Pizza

### SPA with Vue.js and C# using .NET Core
A web app where users can signup/login, and just tell us how much they love pizzas by pressing an "I love it" button.
There are no restrictions on the number of times each user can tell us their appreciation, the only requirement is that only logged in users can vote.
In the home page, along with the signup/login buttons, we can put a little bar-chart displaying the top 10 users with the highest appreciation (in the X-axis) and in the Y-axis the number of votes.

### Pre-requisites
- Node.js & npm

### Users

Register a new one via SIGN UP option on the login screen.
